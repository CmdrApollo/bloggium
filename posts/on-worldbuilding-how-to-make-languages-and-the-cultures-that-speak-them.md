# Introduction

Worldbuilding has become a thing of legend in recent years, seen as a difficult artform meant for the lucky few who can grasp its many complexities. Despite this, I believe that you needn’t be a creative genius to begin worldbuilding and creating interesting works. This guide aims to deconstruct the complexities of worldbuilding into its principal parts and give you the tools to arrange the parts as you see fit. Worldbuilding is also an essential skill for science-fiction or fantasy authors, as even a decent grasp on worldbuilding can have the ability to transform otherwise mediocre works into modern classics.  

Worldbuilding is an incredibly deep topic that I believe no singular text could faithfully explore in its entirety. In lieu of this, this guide focuses solely on constructed languages and cultures, or conlangs and concultures. Conlanging is the art of creating constructed languages, or conlangs. Most widely known for their portrayal in certain pieces of media such as *Lord of the Rings*, *Star Trek*, and *Game of Thrones*, conlangs are a niche but highly expressive form of art. There are many different types of conlangs, including naturalistic conlangs, auxiliary conlangs (auxlangs), artistic conlangs (artlangs), and many more. Despite this multitude of possibilities, the parts of this guide dedicated to conlangs will focus on naturalistic conlangs, how they differ from natural languages (natlangs), how to make them, and how to incorporate them into larger worldbuilding projects. On the other side of the coin lie concultures. Concultures are, as previously stated, constructed, fictional cultures that typically reside within fictional worlds (or at least fictional versions of Earth). Concultures and naturalistic conlangs, more often than not, go hand-in-hand. Although concultures can exist without naturalistic conlangs to back them up, the reverse is generally not true. For this reason and for the sake of example, I will be covering concultures before moving on to conlangs. Throughout this guide, I will be creating an example conculture and subsequent conlang in order to demonstrate the principles presented.

## Beginnings of a Conculture

To create a conculture, you must first think about the environment in which that culture is being formed. Are they from a dense forested area, open plains, arid desert, or rugged mountains? Deciding where a culture resides will inform many of the decisions you make down the road. That being said, I am no expert on geography nor how different biomes get formed, rainshadows, plate tectonics, or anything like that; for that reason, I won’t be going into mapmaking or anything beyond choosing in what biome or climate zone a culture resides.
